TeamCity plugin for CxSAST scanning
===================================


BUILD
-----
Issue 'mvn package' command from the root project to build your plugin. Resulting package cxplugin.zip will be placed in 'target' directory.


INSTALL
-------
To install the plugin, go to "Administration" -> "Plugins List" -> "Upload plugin zip". Choose the cxplugin.zip file. Restart TeamCity server and all build agents.


CONFIGURE
---------
1. Go to "Administration" -> "Integrations" -> "Checkmarx" to edit the default server configuration.
2. Server certificates are validated, so if HTTPS is used for the Checkmarx server communication then make sure the certificate CA is included in the local Teamcity JRE cacerts keystore.
3. To add a Checkmarx Build Step to a Build Configuration, go to the "Build Configuration Settings" page and then "Build Steps". Choose "Add build step" and then "Checkmarx".
